    use
    tools and repair bicycles without direct supervision. It is my responsibility to fully understand that instruction.

  substantial rights by signing this agreement, have signed it voluntarily and without any inducement or assurance of
  any nature and intend it to be a complete and unconditional release of all liability to the greatest extent allowed by
